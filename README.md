# C_App_TidemanVoting

This is a program to simulate a Tideman voting type election. This program takes a sequence of votes and the candidates to whom those votes will go to as input, and it will output the winner.

Remember this project was made for cs50's Problem Set. So to run this, you are going to need to download cs50.h library to your system since there is no such a thing as "string" keyword in C, or feel free to mess with the code by using proper syntax (char str, char str[]).

*If you dont know how low-level implementations for strings are made in C, I suggest you to check it out, it is actually fun.
